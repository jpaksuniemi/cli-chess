# cli-chess

Personal project for practicing OOP, data structures and user input.

The aim for this project is to implement a chess game that is playable on a CLI. It will feature only singleplayer functionalities. When I get the project ready, I am looking forward to implementing a GUI and multiplayer functionalities over the internet.
